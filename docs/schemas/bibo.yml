      书目本体以RDF格式描述语义网中的书目信息。
      该本体可以用于引证本体、文档分类本体，或者仅仅作为以RDF描述任何文档的一种方式。
      它的灵感来自于许多现有的文档描述元数据格式，可用于转换其他书目数据源的一个共同基础。

          We are not defining, using an enumeration, the range of the bibo:degree to the defined list of bibo:
          ThesisDegree. We won&#39;t do it because we want people to be able to define new degress if needed
           by some special usecases. Creating such an enumeration would restrict this to happen.
